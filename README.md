# Cache Bank Landing Portfolio piece 

# Overview
In this project, I recreated a landing piece for Cache Bank focusing on HTML,CSS layout and styling,Tailwind,Javascript. This involved applying various CSS techniques and Tailwind to achieve a responsive, aesthetically pleasing design that functions well across different devices.

# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
 CSS Layout Techniques: I feel confident in using Flexbox and Grid to structure web page elements. Grid layout for the card section to arrange the cards in responsive design.

Responsive Design:I succesfully created responsive landing page for Cache Bank queries reflecting provided Portfolio componets using HTML,CSS and Javascript to make sure it looks good on desktop and mobile device.Made use of the Aria role to provide the sematic meaning to the feature elements.

Styling Elements: I was able to use Tailwind grid layout for alignment and responsive design.CSS layoouts were used to present data and compleling call to action elements were designed to encourage user needs.

HTML5 and Javascript:They were used for the contact section.Used Javascript to animate the statistics counters when they come to view point.
# Challenges Faced

Javascript function:Calling event listeners to detect onclick on the toogle button was challenging and even making it visisble on small screen sizes was difficult.Adding certain features which required me to add Javascript .
Adjusting layouts and font sizes for smaller screens was challenging. I had to experiment with different approaches to ensure the design remained consistent and functional.

Hover and Focus Effects:Implementing interactive elements like hover and focus effects required more practice and research to get them right.I was able to use it on Component 3.

# Areas for Improvement
Advanced CSS Properties: I want to explore more advanced CSS properties and animations to enhance the user experience and Tailwind to maintain a cohesive look and feel.

Code Optimization: My code archieved a desired outcome and I'll improve in CSS properties and animations to enhance user experience.

Creative Design Choices:I adhered closely to the Banking App, for practice but would like to experiment with more creative design choices in future projects.
